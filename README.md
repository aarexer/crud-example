Simple CRUD application with JDBC and SQLite

This project is very simple dummy example for CRUD application.

In this project we learn how to create simple JDBC connection as Singleton.
After that we will create dummy DAO for only one model - Person.

We will create interface DAO and implementation on JDBC.
And cover all code with logging.

### Inside:
* JDBC and SQLite as database
* Plain SQL without any ORM frameworks
* Singleton pattern for connection
* DAO pattern
* Java 8
* Maven
* JUnit4 for tests
